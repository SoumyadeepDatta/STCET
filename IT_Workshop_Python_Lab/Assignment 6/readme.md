3. Write a Python program to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one using loop.
4. Write a Python program to multiply all the items in a dictionary.book
5. Write a Python program to sort a dictionary by key.
6. Write a Python program to check a dictionary is empty or not.
7. Write a Python program which creates two dictionaries. One that stores conversion values from meters to centimeters and the other that stores the reverse.

# Questionnaires
1. What are the advantages of dictionary over list?
```
It is more efficient to use a dictionary for lookup of elements because it takes less time to traverse in the dictionary than a list. For example, letâ€™s consider a data set with 5000000 elements in a machine learning model that relies on the speed of retrieval of data. To implement this we have to choose wisely between two data structure i.e. list and dictionary. The dictionary is preferred because of less time and less space storage as dictionaries are implemented in the form of hash tables from python3.6 so it is never a space-time trade-off problem in dictionaries. It takes more time for fetching a single element in a list than that of a dictionary because dictionary uses hash table for implementing the arrangement.
