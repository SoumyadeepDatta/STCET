# Questionnaires:
**1. Why lists are called mutable?**\
Lists are mutable. i.e their value can be changed by adding or changing an element in it.
```python
l=[1,2,3]
l[1]="4" #this is completely fine & raise no error
l.append("5") #a new element is added to the list
```
Hence lists are mutable in nature.\
**2. What are the advantages of using list compared to array in C?**\
a.List can consists of various data types while an array can contain only one data type of elements.\
b.Can be nested to contain different type of elements.\
c.Greater flexibility allows easy modification (addition, deletion) of data.\
d.The entire list can be printed without using any loop.
