# Constructor
1. Create a class called Student containing student ID and Student name. Create a default constructor with a default value ID as 122 and name as “STCET student” . Also show if the programmer is not creating any constructor then what is the output.
2. Create a parameterized constructor of class Employee having EID, Ename, Dept ( Sales, IT, accounts, HR). Display the record of five employees having all the mentioned characteristics.
3. Implement the details of five students with the attributes mentioned in question1 using an array of objects.
# Method and constructor overloading
4. Create a class called shape which has members called calarea() and display(). Calculate the area for three different shapes: triangle (scalene triangle), rectangle and circle. Apply method overloading to control the area parameter and display the area through main.
5. Create class sum and demonstrate constructor overloading py adding two, three parameters. If someone passes no parameter the message will display “ Bucket is empty”.
